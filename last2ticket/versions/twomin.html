        <p>In April, <a href="#http://thenewdigitalschool.com/" target="_blank">The New Digital School</a> invited companies to partner up with designers on UX projects. We got the chance to work with Last2Ticket, a ticketing platform that empowers event organizers (partners) and attendees with flexible e-ticketing tools.

        <h2 class="Case-title">Major findings from user research</h2>
        <p>During tests, users had points of low emotional state, triggered by interface issues that resulted in a slower buying process. These manifested in:
        <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Users felt <span style="font-weight:800;">frustrated</span> when they found out that they had to login/register to buy a ticket.</li>
                <li>Users felt <span style="font-weight:800;">surprised</span> with the number of input fields on the registration page. They described them as being "too many". They also felt uncomfortable when the widget prompted them to share their phone numbers. </li>
                <li>Users felt <span style="font-weight:800;">anxious</span> about the popup screens and the pre-payment screen.</li>

        <br><br>
        The TNDS methodology and the dynamics applied to the challenge resulted in valid, valuable, attentive and business oriented inputs. Also, they allowed to go even further, bringing disruptive ideas and processes.”
